Thanks for your interest in ReactionDiffusionLab. This software requires no installation. If you keep the ReactionDiffusionLab.m file in the same folder as the notebook you're working in, then all you have to do to load the package is to enter

	Get[NotebookDirectory[] <> "ReactionDiffusionLab.m"]

If you know what you're doing, you can install it in any appropriate place and load it differently. Do whatever you like.

Happy reacting, and peaceful diffusing.

P.S. If you have a cool example, I would love to hear from you.
